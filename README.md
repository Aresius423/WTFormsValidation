Developed and tested with Python 3.8 and WTForms 2.3.1
Compatible with Python 3.6 and Python 3.7

## Supported validators

Here you can see which libraries are currently supported or planned to be added, and which WTForms validators are supported by them.  
Validators marked with an R are supported via regexes. Using multiple regex-backed validators concurrently will disable all but the last one.

¹ These libraries have built-in support for e-mail and URL validation, but you can choose to use the WTFormsValidation's regex validators instead. Defaults to built-in, unless that requires WTFormsValidation to change the field's type (in the case of YairEO and Bouncer.js)  
² Same behaviour as DataRequired  
³ Due to a bug in YairEO, only fields marked as required are validated, so currently this should have no effect  
⁴ With YairEO currently you can only override the default messages

## Running the sample application

* Create a virtualenv ```virtualenv -p python3.8 venv```
* Activate it ```. venv/bin/activate```
* Install the sample's requirements ```pip install -r sample/requirements.txt```
* Run ```python -m sample.sample_app```
* Use the navbar to select which validator's demo you wish to examine.

## Usage

Adding the validator library's boilerplate code should be done according to their documentation. Integrate WTFormsValidator as described below.

### Integrating with YairEO

Using the default settings for the tagger class:
```
from WTFormsValidation import yairify
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=yairify(form))
```

or by instantiating the tagger class yourself:
```
from WTFormsValidation.tagging.yaireo import YairEOtagger
yaireo_tagger = YairEOtagger(email_builtin=True, url_builtin=True)  # defaults negated
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=yaireo_tagger.extend(form))
```

### Integrating with ParsleyJS

Using the default settings for the tagger class:
```
from WTFormsValidation import parslify
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=parslify(form))
```

or by instantiating the tagger class yourself:
```
from WTFormsValidation.tagging.parsley import ParsleyTagger
parsley_tagger = ParsleyTagger(email_builtin=False, url_builtin=False)  # defaults negated
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=parsley_tagger.extend(form))
```

### Integrating with Bouncer.js

Using the default settings for the tagger class:
```
from WTFormsValidation import bouncify
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=bouncify(form))
```

or by instantiating the tagger class yourself:
```
from WTFormsValidation.tagging.bouncer import BouncerTagger
bouncer_tagger = BouncerTagger(email_builtin=True, url_builtin=True)  # defaults negated
...
render_template('your_template.html', form=bouncer_tagger.extend(form))
```

## Implementing custom behaviour

You can inherit from the default tagger classes (YairEOtagger, ParsleyTagger, BouncerTagger) and override any handler functions to suit your use case.
